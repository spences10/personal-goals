## 2017 Jul 24

**What I did do last week:**

- [x] Chungu voyage init :fire:

**What I didn't finish last week:**

**Plan for this week:**

- [ ] Configure the RAN bootstrap for Chungus Voyage, for me this is getting a schema to work with the bootstrap

**Unplanned:**

- [ ] Started some work on the 100 days of code twitter bot, to use a GraphCool project to store the tweets

**Thoughts üí≠**

We have taken on a massive challenge in our Chingus team with trying to get a React Apollo [GraphQL] and Next.js bootstrap stack up and running for out Sinlge Page Application

The RAN stack is being problematic to take the existing functionality and map it to a new backend that we can use ourselves. It's becoming time-consuming and is holding the project up, issues have been raised, forum posts, posted, my patience getting tested.

## 2017 Jul 24

**What I did do last week:**

- [x] Get familiar with GraphQL, maybe add a bit of functionality to the twitter-bot-twit change I made last week
- [x] Start Chingu Voyage

**What I didn't finish last week:**

- [ ] I want to get some Follower/Unfolloer information into graphcool, not planned but a thought whilst doing this.

**Plan for this week:**

- [x] Chungu voyage init :fire:

**Unplanned:**

- [x] GraphQL getting started

**Thoughts üí≠**

This week I will be getting to know my new cohorts and working in a remote dev team to do one of two things, make a bot [of some description] or make a clone of the site jobbatical.

My cohorts have come up with a great idea for what we're going to do for the Chungu Voyage were going to make a Single Page Application that other people can use to co-share or find a workspace and we're calling it HuddleHunt!

GraphQL is one of the requirements we have for HuddleHunt so I decided to take a egghead.io course on it, it got pretty confusing towards the end.

Made a bit of progress on the Twiotter bot follower/unfollower function which still needs some work.

## 2017 Jul 17

**What I did do last week:**

- [x] Made a Settings repo https://github.com/spences10/settings
- [x] Made a Tooling repo https://github.com/spences10/tooling
- [x] Bearded Dragons Chingu finished

**What I didn't finish last week:**

- [ ] Twitter bot GraphQL backend (unfinished functionality)

**Plan for this week:**

- [x] Get familiar with GraphQL, maybe add a bit of functionality to the twitter-bot-twit change I made last week

**Unplanned:**

- [x] Start Chingu Voyage

**Thoughts üí≠**

The guys at graphcool were really helpful in getting me set up with a backend API thank you to @nilan from graphcool for your perseverance sir! I now have a working example of a selective retweet now so the RT on stream feature can eventually go to the Twitter bot bootstrap.

I'm reasonably happy with this functionality and have deployed to the master branch of my twitter-bot-twit repo, it needs work but so far I'm happy with the results.

## 2017 Jul 10

**What I did do last week:**

- [ ] Made a [PR][tsbookpr] for [typescript-book][tsbook]

**What I didn't finish last week:**

- [ ] Progress cohorts bot work

**Plan for this week:**

Try get some sort of backend sorted for the twitter bot

**Unplanned**

Settings repo https://github.com/spences10/settings

**Thoughts üí≠**

Job interview on 20170710 üëç for something related to my current skillset but the possibility of moving into web related tech down the line.

Not heard back about the interview, so we'll take that as a no for now, the agent said that we'd hear back by Wednesday so I'll chase for feedback Monday.

I have gone through several getting started with GraphQL one which didn't work and another which was painful to navigate through, I have now got a guy from GraphCool on slack talking me through it.

Overall I'm really frustrated at the moment with progress on all the things, everything is shit üí©

## 2017 Jul 03

**What I did do last week:**

- [x] Finished üò¢ Learn Node w/ @WesBos https://yummers.scottspence.me
- [ ] Create a Twitter bot in TypeScript

**What I didn't finish last week:**

- [ ] [Node basics][node-basics] with Emanuel Quimper

**Plan for this week:**

- [ ] Progress cohorts bot work

**Unplanned**


**Thoughts üí≠**

Watching the MVA on bot with Node, pretty neat, I quite like the Microsoft Virtual Academy. All the code examples do not work so looks like something in the framework has changed, I'm pretty bummed out by this.

With regard to TypeScript I have spent the best part of Sunday watching videos on how to migrate from JS to TS and felt completely overwhelmed, I'm trying to convert my current twitter bot playground over to TS and have managed to make a simple bot, I'm getting really hung up on what types to use that I'm making literally no progress in converting it all.

I found a really nice guy on Twitter @LukeStonehm that helped out with some starter examples on making classes and interfaces with TypeScript.

Looking at storing tweets so the bot doesnt retweet already tweeted retweets, I tried to find some simple examples using MongoDB with express but all seem to not work or have outdated warnings, I'm going to take some time today to see if I can do it using GraphQL.

## 2017 Jun 26

**What I did do last week:**

- [x] Progress Learn Node w/ @WesBos
- [x] Start cohorts bot work

**What I didn't finish last week:**

- [ ] [Node basics][node-basics] with Emanuel Quimper
- [ ] Twitter bot work, filtered follow

**Plan for this week:**

- [x] Progress Learn Node w/ @WesBos - finished! https://yumers.scottspence.me
- [ ] Progress cohorts bot work
- [x] Twitter bot work, filtered follow

**Unplanned**

- [ ] Create a Twitter bot in TypeScript


**Thoughts üí≠**

Looking into TypeScript, I found a starter project here: https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript-Node-Starter thanks to @AmanMittal :+1:.

My cohorts have barely been in touch this week for the chingu challenge thing, I haven't done a great deal of work with the botbuilder stuff either though to be honest. I have found Microsoft Channel 9 and the Microsoft Virtual Academy though which are proving helpful.

**Thoughts üí≠**

Filtered follow is being a bit painful as I have to deal with promises üôÉ

There's certainly a lot of bot frameworks out there! My cohorts and I seem unable to settle on a framework, @a-sep and I have both had a look at the MS Botframework and so far this is the one which make the most sense to us, basically it has documentation you can follow :+1:

**Unplanned**

Nothing unplanned this week, just coasting as I'm feeling pretty burnt out last week or so

**Thoughts üí≠**

Made some ok progress with the Twitter bot filtered follow, still a bit to do with regard to scoring. `filtered-follow` will search a users timeline for keywords that are pulled from a gist.

Was nice to meet all my cohorts, we're still discussing a way forward with what is going to be a slack bot

**Unplanned**

- [x] GraphQL with Apollo

**Thoughts üí≠**

The styled-jsx change I was hoping for wasn't added to next so I couldn't progress my portfolio page any further. Not feeling the learn node courses, EQuimpers one I have issues with posting via postman to the mongodb server so got frustrated with that. The Wes Bos course I haven't gone near singe Compass failed on the data visualization section the team behind it aren't very responsive or descriptive when it comes to letting you know what the issue is and if it's being fixed, so got frustrated and lost interest with that as well.

With GraphQL I don't understand how this works just yet, theres the `graphcool` package which you install then theres the `graphcool playground` where is the api? hosted locally I guess? There's a lot the [tutorial][gcl-tut] doesn't cover

## 2017 May 29

**What I did do last week:**

- [x] Played with styled components and nextjs
- [x] New iteration of the [`twitterbot bootstrap`][twee-bo-boo]

**What I didn't finish last week:**

- [ ] [TypeScript React Starter][ts-react-starter]

**Plan for this week:**

- [ ] [Node basics][node-basics] with Emanuel Quimper
- [ ] Progress Learn Node w/ @WesBos

**Thoughts üí≠**

Nextjs is great, saved a load of time not messing around with react-router for links, the TypeScript react starter all went a bit shit and I lost interest with it.

For some reason I'm really struggling with both the node courses I'm doing, both great content but I just seem to have little to no interest once things go a bit wrong, I haven't gone back to the Wes Bos course since Compass started playing up, I think I may have left it too long now to pick up again and should probably start again.

**Thoughts üí≠**

Twitter bot playground was a pretty big writeup, I started the TypeScript react starter but need to get back to it.

With regard to the Wes Bos NodeJS course I keep getting errors on compass still waiting to hear back from the support team after giving feedback.

`now` I'm loving `zeit` and all their awesomeness üëçüëå

## 2017 May 08

**What I did do last week:**

- [x] JavaScript30 - all done üòÄ

**What I didn't finish last week:**

**Plan for this week:**

- [x] Repurpose the [`twitter-bot-playground`][twit-bot-playground] repo
- [ ] [TypeScript React Starter][ts-react-starter]
- [x] Worked on [ArcherBot][archerbot]
  * Like functionality
- [x] Start Learn Node w/ @WesBos

**Thoughts üí≠**

The Twitter bot tutorials I followed from [egghead.io][egghead-twitter-bot-course] I would recommend üëå, I have been struggling with my next iteration of the [Twitter bot boot strap][twitter-bot-bootstrap] and this course really helped with some of the fundamentals of the Twitter API.

The [`twitter-bot-playground`][twit-bot-playground] was pretty good to deploy to `now` rather than `Heroku` admittedly I spent way too long trying to debug an issue that was just some similarly named vars.

## 2017 May 15

**What I did do last week:**

- [x] Repurpose the [`twitter-bot-playground`][twit-bot-playground] repo
- [x] Worked on [ArcherBot][archerbot]
  * Like functionality
- [x] Start Learn Node w/ @WesBos

**What I didn't finish last week:**

- [ ] [TypeScript React Starter][ts-react-starter]

**Plan for this week:**

- [x] Writeup for [`twitter-bot-playground`][twit-bot-playground] repo
- [ ] [TypeScript React Starter][ts-react-starter]
- [ ] Progress Learn Node w/ @WesBos
- [x] Personal site on `now`

**Thoughts üí≠**

Twitter bot playground was a pretty big writeup, I started the TypeScript react starter but need to get back to it.

With regard to the Wes Bos NodeJS course I keep getting errors on compass still waiting to hear back from the support team after giving feedback.

`now` I'm loving `zeit` and all their awesomeness üëçüëå

**What I did do last week:**

- [x] JavaScript30 - all done üòÄ

**What I didn't finish last week:**

**Plan for this week:**

- [x] Repurpose the [`twitter-bot-playground`][twit-bot-playground] repo
- [ ] [TypeScript React Starter][ts-react-starter]
- [x] Worked on [ArcherBot][archerbot]
  * Like functionality
- [x] Start Learn Node w/ @WesBos

**Thoughts üí≠**

The Twitter bot tutorials I followed from [egghead.io][egghead-twitter-bot-course] I would recommend üëå, I have been struggling with my next iteration of the [Twitter bot boot strap][twitter-bot-bootstrap] and this course really helped with some of the fundamentals of the Twitter API.

The [`twitter-bot-playground`][twit-bot-playground] was pretty good to deploy to `now` rather than `Heroku` admittedly I spent way too long trying to debug an issue that was just some similarly named vars.

**What I didn't finish last week:**

- [ ] Twitter bot sentiment detection
- [ ] Twitter bot re-tweet functionality with `twitter` package

**Plan for this week:**

**Thoughts üí≠**

Decided to churn my way through JavaScript30 a lot of the lessons I revisited but it was well worth it learned a lot [again maybe]

## 2017 April 24

**What I did do last week:**

- [x] Learn redux with Wes Bos
- [x] Create react to-do app :+1:

**What I didn't finish last week:**

**Plan for this week:**

**Thoughts üí≠**

Seems that the react online training and A workshop for react are pretty dated so for now I'm going to move onto something else less so.

The twitter bot work is on hold for now as I can't get the retweet functionality to work

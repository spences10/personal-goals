**Thoughts 💭**

Reading through Deep Work by Cal Newport I understand where I may be going wrong with recent slumps in productivity and motivation, this along with a conversation with Wes Bos via his [ama](https://github.com/wesbos/ama/issues/188) I'm hoping I can start to turn things around again 😄

## 2017 Sep 25

**What I did do last week:**

- [x] Met with Tom to discuss HuddleHunt

**What I didn't finish last week:**

- [ ] Get HuddleHunt up and running!

**Plan for this week:**

- [ ] Get HuddleHunt up and running!

**Unplanned:**

- [x] Migrate to Gatsby v1+
  * Need to get images working again, I seem to have broken it

**Thoughts 💭**

Now looking for work, I have an interview lined up for monday with an energy trader.

It has been a really slow couple of weeks, partly because of the work situation partly because of burn out. Think I'm not on my third burn out of the year 🙃 it gets to a point where I feel completely overwhelmed with everything and as a result nothing happens.

I'm hoping I can get back into the swing of things with concentrating on one piece of work at a time.

**Update 20171001:** Spent the majority of my time putting my Gatsby site together and the rest of that getting familiar with different command line shells.

With Windows Subsystem Linux you have an Ubuntu instance in your Windows machine I spent way too much time familiarising myself with bash, zsh and fish shell 🐚, by far my favourite is Fish mainly for the command intellisense 👌

For the role I interviewed for on Monday I have been asked back for a second interview with another two candidates, no word on when this will be.

## 2017 Sep 18

**What I did do last week:**

- [x] Very little
- [x] Did a bit of work on https://github.com/spences10/characters-from-password

**What I didn't finish last week:**

- [ ] Get HuddleHunt up and running!

**Plan for this week:**

- [ ] Get HuddleHunt up and running!

**Unplanned:**


**Thoughts 💭**

My day job has become quite difficult since coming back from holiday, new manager, clearly doesn't trust me and has been clearly frustrated when I have a sit down/catch-up and talks about current workload.

I can understand he will be under a fair bit of pressure both from himself starting in a new role and company and from his hiring manager.

With this [unnecessary] pressure from my client and with returning from holiday the last seven days have been a bit of a shock to the system, I haven't wanted to get out of bed of a mornings and in the evenings I'm pretty bummed out from work.

**Update for 18/09/2017:** I had my contract cut short from my current client, I'm now looking for a new client.

## 2017 Sep 11

**What I did do last week:**

- [x] Relax

**What I didn't finish last week:**

- [ ] Get HuddleHunt up and running!

**Plan for this week:**

- [ ] Get HuddleHunt up and running!

**Unplanned:**

- [x] Did a bit of work on https://github.com/spences10/characters-from-password

**Thoughts 💭**

First full week back at it now after a few weeks break for a holiday 👌, this week there's a need to focus on getting something rolling wih HuddleHunt we have been pretty bogged down with the boilerplate we're using and we're beginning to wonder if it will be less time consuming if we use something different.

## 2017 Sep 04

**What I did do last week:**

- [x] Relax

**What I didn't finish last week:**

**Plan for this week:**

- [ ] Get HuddleHunt up and running!

**Unplanned:**

- [ ] Terrible first few days back at work

**Thoughts 💭**

Good times :palm_tree: :shell: 🏖️

Holiday was the best! Getting back to work wasn't! The working situation has changed on the current contract with the client adding unnecessary requests on my time making it pretty poor working environment, that coupled with the work being menial it's not a great place to be right now.


## 2017 Aug 28

**What I did do last week:**

- [x] Relax

**What I didn't finish last week:**

**Plan for this week:**

- [x] Go to Cyprus for x2 weeks
- [x] Relax

**Unplanned:**


**Thoughts 💭**

Good times :palm_tree: :shell: 🏖️😎

## 2017 Aug 21

**What I did do last week:**

- [x] Nothing completed

**What I didn't finish last week:**

**Plan for this week:**

- [ ] Go to Cyprus for x2 weeks
- [x] Relax

**Unplanned:**


**Thoughts 💭**

The last several weeks have been pretty stressful with work and I have had a load of anxiety around several unfinished projects I have going, feeling pretty burnt out generally

## 2017 Aug 14

**What I did do last week:**

- [x] [howtographql.com](howtographql.com) really useful! https://github.com/spences10/hackernews-react-apollo demo here: https://hnc.scottspence.me/

**What I didn't finish last week:**

**Plan for this week:**

- [ ] Configure the RAN bootstrap for Chungus Voyage, for me this is getting a schema to work with the bootstrap
- [ ] 100 days of code twitter bot, to use a GraphCool project to store the tweets

**Unplanned:**


**Thoughts 💭**

Looks like the issues we were having with the RAN boilerplate were resolved in a recent PR, just a case of merging and seeing if were have something to work with. :+1:

## 2017 Aug 07

**What I did do last week:**

- [x] nothing!

**What I didn't finish last week:**

**Plan for this week:**

- [ ] Configure the RAN bootstrap for Chungus Voyage, for me this is getting a schema to work with the bootstrap
- [ ] 100 days of code twitter bot, to use a GraphCool project to store the tweets

**Unplanned:**

- [x] [howtographql.com](howtographql.com) really useful! https://github.com/spences10/hackernews-react-apollo demo here: https://hnc.scottspence.me/

**Thoughts 💭**

I seem to have missed a week! 🙃 The situation is RAN stack we need configured for the Chungus voyage project is being blocked until we get a backend up and running I'm finding it quite frustrating at the moment. The 100 days of code bot is getting some love because I can't move forward with the Chingus project.

I decided to do the hacker news clone as part of the how to graphql tutorial, was an eye opener.
## 2017 Jul 31

**What I did do last week:**

- [x] Chungu voyage init :fire:

**What I didn't finish last week:**

**Plan for this week:**

- [ ] Configure the RAN bootstrap for Chungus Voyage, for me this is getting a schema to work with the bootstrap

**Unplanned:**

- [ ] Started some work on the 100 days of code twitter bot, to use a GraphCool project to store the tweets

**Thoughts 💭**

The RAN stack is being problematic to take the existing functionality and map it to a new backend that we can use ourselves. It's becoming time-consuming and is holding the project up, issues have been raised, forum posts, posted, my patience getting tested.

## 2017 Jul 24

**What I did do last week:**

- [x] Chungu voyage init :fire:

**What I didn't finish last week:**

**Plan for this week:**

- [ ] Configure the RAN bootstrap for Chungus Voyage, for me this is getting a schema to work with the bootstrap

**Unplanned:**

**Thoughts 💭**

We have taken on a massive challenge in our Chingus team with trying to get a React Apollo [GraphQL] and Next.js bootstrap stack up and running for out Sinlge Page Application

## 2017 Jul 24

**What I did do last week:**

- [x] Get familiar with GraphQL, maybe add a bit of functionality to the twitter-bot-twit change I made last week
- [x] Start Chingu Voyage

**What I didn't finish last week:**

- [ ] I want to get some Follower/Unfolloer information into graphcool, not planned but a thought whilst doing this.

**Plan for this week:**

- [x] Chungu voyage init :fire:

**Unplanned:**

- [x] GraphQL getting started

**Thoughts 💭**

This week I will be getting to know my new cohorts and working in a remote dev team to do one of two things, make a bot [of some description] or make a clone of the site jobbatical.

My cohorts have come up with a great idea for what we're going to do for the Chungu Voyage were going to make a Single Page Application that other people can use to co-share or find a workspace and we're calling it HuddleHunt!

GraphQL is one of the requirements we have for HuddleHunt so I decided to take a egghead.io course on it, it got pretty confusing towards the end.

Made a bit of progress on the Twiotter bot follower/unfollower function which still needs some work.

## 2017 Jul 17

**What I did do last week:**

- [x] Made a Settings repo https://github.com/spences10/settings
- [x] Made a Tooling repo https://github.com/spences10/tooling
- [x] Bearded Dragons Chingu finished

**What I didn't finish last week:**

- [ ] Twitter bot GraphQL backend (unfinished functionality)

**Plan for this week:**

- [x] Get familiar with GraphQL, maybe add a bit of functionality to the twitter-bot-twit change I made last week

**Unplanned:**

- [x] Start Chingu Voyage

**Thoughts 💭**

The guys at graphcool were really helpful in getting me set up with a backend API thank you to @nilan from graphcool for your perseverance sir! I now have a working example of a selective retweet now so the RT on stream feature can eventually go to the Twitter bot bootstrap.

I'm reasonably happy with this functionality and have deployed to the master branch of my twitter-bot-twit repo, it needs work but so far I'm happy with the results.

## 2017 Jul 10

**What I did do last week:**

- [ ] Made a [PR][tsbookpr] for [typescript-book][tsbook]

**What I didn't finish last week:**

- [ ] Progress cohorts bot work

**Plan for this week:**

Try get some sort of backend sorted for the twitter bot

**Unplanned**

Settings repo https://github.com/spences10/settings

**Thoughts 💭**

Job interview on 20170710 👍 for something related to my current skillset but the possibility of moving into web related tech down the line.

Not heard back about the interview, so we'll take that as a no for now, the agent said that we'd hear back by Wednesday so I'll chase for feedback Monday.

I have gone through several getting started with GraphQL one which didn't work and another which was painful to navigate through, I have now got a guy from GraphCool on slack talking me through it.

Overall I'm really frustrated at the moment with progress on all the things, everything is shit 💩

## 2017 Jul 03

**What I did do last week:**

- [x] Finished 😢 Learn Node w/ @WesBos https://yummers.scottspence.me
- [ ] Create a Twitter bot in TypeScript

**What I didn't finish last week:**

- [ ] [Node basics][node-basics] with Emanuel Quimper

**Plan for this week:**

- [ ] Progress cohorts bot work

**Unplanned**


**Thoughts 💭**

Watching the MVA on bot with Node, pretty neat, I quite like the Microsoft Virtual Academy. All the code examples do not work so looks like something in the framework has changed, I'm pretty bummed out by this.

With regard to TypeScript I have spent the best part of Sunday watching videos on how to migrate from JS to TS and felt completely overwhelmed, I'm trying to convert my current twitter bot playground over to TS and have managed to make a simple bot, I'm getting really hung up on what types to use that I'm making literally no progress in converting it all.

I found a really nice guy on Twitter @LukeStonehm that helped out with some starter examples on making classes and interfaces with TypeScript.

Looking at storing tweets so the bot doesnt retweet already tweeted retweets, I tried to find some simple examples using MongoDB with express but all seem to not work or have outdated warnings, I'm going to take some time today to see if I can do it using GraphQL.

**Thoughts 💭**

Looking into TypeScript, I found a starter project here: https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript-Node-Starter thanks to @AmanMittal :+1:.

My cohorts have barely been in touch this week for the chingu challenge thing, I haven't done a great deal of work with the botbuilder stuff either though to be honest. I have found Microsoft Channel 9 and the Microsoft Virtual Academy though which are proving helpful.

**Thoughts 💭**

Filtered follow is being a bit painful as I have to deal with promises 🙃

There's certainly a lot of bot frameworks out there! My cohorts and I seem unable to settle on a framework, @a-sep and I have both had a look at the MS Botframework and so far this is the one which make the most sense to us, basically it has documentation you can follow :+1:

Nothing unplanned this week, just coasting as I'm feeling pretty burnt out last week or so

**Thoughts 💭**

Made some ok progress with the Twitter bot filtered follow, still a bit to do with regard to scoring. `filtered-follow` will search a users timeline for keywords that are pulled from a gist.

Was nice to meet all my cohorts, we're still discussing a way forward with what is going to be a slack bot

**Thoughts 💭**

The styled-jsx change I was hoping for wasn't added to next so I couldn't progress my portfolio page any further. Not feeling the learn node courses, EQuimpers one I have issues with posting via postman to the mongodb server so got frustrated with that. The Wes Bos course I haven't gone near singe Compass failed on the data visualization section the team behind it aren't very responsive or descriptive when it comes to letting you know what the issue is and if it's being fixed, so got frustrated and lost interest with that as well.

With GraphQL I don't understand how this works just yet, theres the `graphcool` package which you install then theres the `graphcool playground` where is the api? hosted locally I guess? There's a lot the [tutorial][gcl-tut] doesn't cover

**What I did do last week:**

- [x] Played with styled components and nextjs
- [x] New iteration of the [`twitterbot bootstrap`][twee-bo-boo]

**What I didn't finish last week:**

- [ ] [TypeScript React Starter][ts-react-starter]

**Plan for this week:**

- [ ] [Node basics][node-basics] with Emanuel Quimper
- [ ] Progress Learn Node w/ @WesBos

**Thoughts 💭**

Nextjs is great, saved a load of time not messing around with react-router for links, the TypeScript react starter all went a bit shit and I lost interest with it.

For some reason I'm really struggling with both the node courses I'm doing, both great content but I just seem to have little to no interest once things go a bit wrong, I haven't gone back to the Wes Bos course since Compass started playing up, I think I may have left it too long now to pick up again and should probably start again.

Twitter bot playground was a pretty big writeup, I started the TypeScript react starter but need to get back to it.

With regard to the Wes Bos NodeJS course I keep getting errors on compass still waiting to hear back from the support team after giving feedback.

`now` I'm loving `zeit` and all their awesomeness 👍👌

**What I did do last week:**

- [x] JavaScript30 - all done 😀

**What I didn't finish last week:**

**Thoughts 💭**

The Twitter bot tutorials I followed from [egghead.io][egghead-twitter-bot-course] I would recommend 👌, I have been struggling with my next iteration of the [Twitter bot boot strap][twitter-bot-bootstrap] and this course really helped with some of the fundamentals of the Twitter API.

The [`twitter-bot-playground`][twit-bot-playground] was pretty good to deploy to `now` rather than `Heroku` admittedly I spent way too long trying to debug an issue that was just some similarly named vars.

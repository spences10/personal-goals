## 2017 Jun 26

**What I did do last week:**

- [x] Progress Learn Node w/ @WesBos
- [x] Start cohorts bot work

**What I didn't finish last week:**

- [ ] [Node basics][node-basics] with Emanuel Quimper
- [ ] Twitter bot work, filtered follow

**Plan for this week:**

- [x] Progress Learn Node w/ @WesBos - finished! https://yumers.scottspence.me
- [ ] Progress cohorts bot work
- [x] Twitter bot work, filtered follow

**Unplanned**

- [ ] Create a Twitter bot in TypeScript


**Thoughts üí≠**

Looking into TypeScript, I found a starter project here: https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript-Node-Starter thanks to @AmanMittal :+1:.

My cohorts have barely been in touch this week for the chingu challenge thing, I haven't done a great deal of work with the botbuilder stuff either though to be honest. I have found Microsoft Channel 9 and the Microsoft Virtual Academy though which are proving helpful.

**Thoughts üí≠**

Filtered follow is being a bit painful as I have to deal with promises üôÉ

There's certainly a lot of bot frameworks out there! My cohorts and I seem unable to settle on a framework, @a-sep and I have both had a look at the MS Botframework and so far this is the one which make the most sense to us, basically it has documentation you can follow :+1:

## 2017 Jun 12

**What I did do last week:**

- [x] Join [Chingu-cohorts][cc]
  - [x] Write Chingu-cohorts intro
- [x] Made some Learn Node progress
- [x] [GraphQL with Apollo][gcl-tut]

**What I didn't finish last week:**

- [] Twitter bot work

**Plan for this week:**

- [x] Twitter bot work
- [] [Node basics][node-basics] with Emanuel Quimper
- [x] Progress Learn Node w/ @WesBos

**Unplanned**

Nothing unplanned this week, just coasting as I'm feeling pretty burnt out last week or so

**Thoughts üí≠**

Made some ok progress with the Twitter bot filtered follow, still a bit to do with regard to scoring. `filtered-follow` will search a users timeline for keywords that are pulled from a gist.

Was nice to meet all my cohorts, we're still discussing a way forward with what is going to be a slack bot

## 2017 Jun 05

**What I did do last week:**

- [x] Added posts to [my blog][blog]
- [x] Git [aliases medium post][git-med-alias]
- [x] [Just starting out with git?][git-start]


**What I didn't finish last week:**

- [ ] [Node basics][node-basics] with Emanuel Quimper
- [ ] Progress Learn Node w/ @WesBos

**Plan for this week:**

- [] More twitter bot work
- [x] Join [Chingu-cohorts][cc]
  - [x] Write Chingu-cohorts intro
- [x] Made some Learn Node progress

**Unplanned**

- [x] GraphQL with Apollo 

**Thoughts üí≠**

The styled-jsx change I was hoping for wasn't added to next so I couldn't progress my portfolio page any further. Not feeling the learn node courses, EQuimpers one I have issues with posting via postman to the mongodb server so got frustrated with that. The Wes Bos course I haven't gone near singe Compass failed on the data visualization section the team behind it aren't very responsive or descriptive when it comes to letting you know what the issue is and if it's being fixed, so got frustrated and lost interest with that as well.

With GraphQL I don't understand how this works just yet, theres the `graphcool` package which you install then theres the `graphcool playground` where is the api? hosted locally I guess? There's a lot the [tutorial][gcl-tut] doesn't cover

## 2017 May 29

**What I did do last week:**

- [x] Played with styled components and nextjs
- [x] New iteration of the [`twitterbot bootstrap`][twee-bo-boo]

**What I didn't finish last week:**

- [ ] [TypeScript React Starter][ts-react-starter]

**Plan for this week:**

- [ ] [Node basics][node-basics] with Emanuel Quimper
- [ ] Progress Learn Node w/ @WesBos

**Thoughts üí≠**

Nextjs is great, saved a load of time not messing around with react-router for links, the TypeScript react starter all went a bit shit and I lost interest with it.

For some reason I'm really struggling with both the node courses I'm doing, both great content but I just seem to have little to no interest once things go a bit wrong, I haven't gone back to the Wes Bos course since Compass started playing up, I think I may have left it too long now to pick up again and should probably start again.

## 2017 May 22

**What I did do last week:**

- [x] Writeup for [`twitter-bot-playground`][twit-bot-playground] repo
- [x] Personal site on `now`

**What I didn't finish last week:**

- [ ] [TypeScript React Starter][ts-react-starter]

**Plan for this week:**

- [ ] [Node basics][node-basics] with Emanuel Quimper
- [ ] Progress Learn Node w/ @WesBos

**Thoughts üí≠**

Twitter bot playground was a pretty big writeup, I started the TypeScript react starter but need to get back to it.

With regard to the Wes Bos NodeJS course I keep getting errors on compass still waiting to hear back from the support team after giving feedback.

`now` I'm loving `zeit` and all their awesomeness üëçüëå

## 2017 May 08

**What I did do last week:**

- [x] JavaScript30 - all done üòÄ

**What I didn't finish last week:**

**Plan for this week:**

- [x] Repurpose the [`twitter-bot-playground`][twit-bot-playground] repo
- [ ] [TypeScript React Starter][ts-react-starter]
- [x] Worked on [ArcherBot][archerbot]
  * Like functionality
- [x] Start Learn Node w/ @WesBos

**Thoughts üí≠**

The Twitter bot tutorials I followed from [egghead.io][egghead-twitter-bot-course] I would recommend üëå, I have been struggling with my next iteration of the [Twitter bot boot strap][twitter-bot-bootstrap] and this course really helped with some of the fundamentals of the Twitter API.

The [`twitter-bot-playground`][twit-bot-playground] was pretty good to deploy to `now` rather than `Heroku` admittedly I spent way too long trying to debug an issue that was just some similarly named vars.

The twitter bot work is on hold for now as I can't get the retweet functionality to work

**Thoughts 💭**

**20180424:** Still getting over this illness, it's really hit me for
six. Lost all motivation to do anything over the weekend, I need to
start listing out small wins to do for confidence and peace of mind.

**20180429:** Been a pretty meh week, a combination of getting over
sickness and at work coming to the realisation that I'll be working
with the most clanky ass unintuitive PoS CMS. I've felt depressed at
the prospect of working with it long term, so much so that it's
affecting my home life.

**Thoughts 💭**

**20180329:** I have spent most of the week trying to get Gatsby and
GraphCMS working together, a lot of it is layout stuff currently 🙃

**20180330:** Happy Easter Friday! I'm becoming more of a fan of Mac
day by day, I'm also struggling more with a Windows keyboard. Why
couldn't Apple use the standard layout 🙃

**20180331:** I'm attempting to move my Gatsby blog from having the
posts stored on the actual site over to GraphCMS, this will lend well
to what I'm trying to accomplish at work as well.

**Thoughts 💭**

**20180226:** I didn't have a great start to the week with an
interview where my web dev trivia was being tested rather than being
asked how I would solve problems. What made this interview worse was
having the interview conducted in a cafeteria at lunch time where I
was also asked to take a technical test 😠

The week picked up as I was offered and have accepted a role as a
front end developer 😂

I had my first face to face with my Chungu cohorts and we planned the
next voyage for `grad.then`

**Thoughts 💭**

**20180211:** I've had a massive drive to get my portfolio completed
and have some projects to demonstrate on there. I find that it's
always that last 10-20% of every project that determines it's success
or not. I proven this to myself with the last several projects I have
done - I'm doing it again with trying to complete Framework of the
Day.

**20180218:** Framework of the Day has taken a back seat until I
finish c-counter. Learned today that patches should be tested in their
own branch before going to the main dev branch 🙃

**Thoughts 💭**

**20180204:** Optimistic about getting several projects done, may try
to write a blog post about styled-components 💅 too 😄

**20180211:** Spent the most part of this week trying to finish off my
Framework of the Day app, based off of the Catch of the Day app it
replaced on my GitHub profile. I decided to go with NextJS this time
round instead of Gatsby still with styled-components 💅 made good
progress, styling taking up the majority of the time 🙃

I had two phone interviews this week as well one leading to a face to
face interview this coming Friday, the other was strange, they were
really keen to speak with me after viewing my GitHub profile but
didn't think I had enough JavaScript knowledge for the role. This
confused and frustrated me as the extent of my knowledge can be
gleaned from my CV which states in the first paragraph that I have got
18 months experience 🤷‍♀

**Thoughts 💭**

**20180128:** Started the week off with a UTI on 20170120 with that
came a terrible fever. I spent the majority of Monday at an urgent
care center waiting to see a GP. I was prescribed strong antibiotics
and as a result have not been able to concentrate on anything longer
than five minutes. I have spent the majority of this week on the sofa
watching Netflix.

**20180131:** Used Gatsby image to lazy load project images on my
portfolio, it took a lot longer than anticipated, I nearly gave up but
my cohort mar-bi encouraged me to take another look and that was all I
needed to make the breakthrough, such a win when that happens 👏 🙏

**20180204:** https://scottspence.me is nerly complete now, Gatsby is
such a nice framework, I'm now trying to redo some projects to add to
my portfolio. characters-from-password, react-stopwatch and
react-for-beginners will all be having a code refresh.

**Thoughts 💭**

**20180121:** I started work on my personal portfolio, I've decided to
do that in Gatsby too, made some good progress but have been a bit
caught up with making it responsive first, I have spent a lot of time
fiddling with grid areas.

**Thoughts 💭**

**20180114:** Shaving the yak! Yes again!!! This time round it was
trying to set up a Travis CI pipeline for my blog which was successful
but only after ~70 builds 🙃.

It did turn out that the tool I was using wasn't compatible with my
pipeline. I wanted to do a static site deploy and although now handles
static sites the tool I was using didn't support that at that time.

I switched to the official Zeit example and set it up relativly
easily.

**20180107:** Shaving the yak! I got caught up with bash issues
through the week so much so that I decided to wipe my laptop and start
again, I have all my data and programs backed up on OneDrive so it
wasn't a really big issue.

I composed a post on configuring WSL as I've done it a few times now
and made notes, switched to `n` from `nvm` and the terminal appears to
be a lot more responsive.

As you can see from my WakaTime activity I shuold be concentrating
more on the `grad.then()` project, it's due to finish 20180114 so me
and the guys wil have a couple of busy day coming up!

**Thoughts ðŸ’­**

**20180114:** Shaving the yak! Yes again!!! This time round it was
trying to set up a Travis CI pipeline for my blog which was successful
but only after ~70 builds ðŸ™ƒ.

It did turn out that the tool I was using wasn't compatible with my
pipeline. I wanted to do a static site deploy and although now handles
static sites the tool I was using didn't support that at that time.

I switched to the official Zeit example and set it up relativly
easily.

**20180107:** Shaving the yak! I got caught up with bash issues
through the week so much so that I decided to wipe my laptop and start
again, I have all my data and programs backed up on OneDrive so it
wasn't a really big issue.

I composed a post on configuring WSL as I've done it a few times now
and made notes, switched to `n` from `nvm` and the terminal appears to
be a lot more responsive.

As you can see from my WakaTime activity I shuold be concentrating
more on the `grad.then()` project, it's due to finish 20180114 so me
and the guys wil have a couple of busy day coming up!

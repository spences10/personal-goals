# Personal Goals

Personal goals for accountability!

This is where I am keeping a log of what I want to achieve, I'll log weekly
tasks which I'll check off as they get completed, tasks that I have not got
round to will added to the list for the next week.

* **[Plan for this week ðŸ‘€](this-week.md#this-week)**

* **[History ðŸ‘µðŸ‘´](history.md#history)**

## Goals for 2018:

* JavaScript - learn it (simples!) :sunglasses:
* Complete freeCodeCamp(:fire:)
  * possibly re start in a 100 days of code fashion
* Personal Site

**Things I'll do in the Future:**

These tasks will be picked off of this list and added to the weekly tasks lists
when I feel that I can complete them. [which basically means do before I'm
distracted by the next new shiny]

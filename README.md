# Personal Goals

Personal goals for accountability!

This is where I am keeping a log of what I want to achieve, I'll log weekly tasks which I'll check off as they get completed, tasks that I have not got round to will added to the list for the next week.

## Goals for 2017:

- JavaScript - learn it (simples!) :sunglasses:
- Complete freeCodeCamp(:fire:)
- Personal Site
- Build Office.js add-ins
  - Using [Office Fabric](https://dev.office.com/fabric#/get-started)

**Things I'll do in the Future:**

These tasks will be picked off of this list and added to the weekly tasks lists when I feel that I can complete them. [which basically means do before I'm distracted by the next new shiny]

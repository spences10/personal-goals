# Personal Goals

Personal goals for accountability!

This is where I am keeping a log of what I want to achieve, I'll log weekly tasks which I'll check off as they get completed, tasks that I have not got round to will added to the list for the next week.

## Goals for 2017:

1. JavaScript - learn it (simples!)
2. Complete freeCodeCamp(:fire:)
3. Build a good portfolio of example web projects 
4. Personal Site - Personal Portfolio
5. Build Office.js add-ins

**Things I'll Do in the Future:**

These tasks will be picked off of this list and added to the weekly tasks lists when I feel that I can complete them. [which basically means do before I'm distracted by the next new shiny]

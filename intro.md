# Hello from London

Hi, I'm Scott Spence ðŸ‘‹

## Backstory

I'm an analyst developer in the financial sector working in the City of London,
I'm marriwed with a beautiful wife and daughter. At 41 I have decided that [as
there are not be as many VBA developer jobs on the market these days] I should
re-skill so that I am still employable in ten more years time.

## Coding history

I learned to code [VBA] whilst working my first 'proper' job at Barclays Bank as
an assistant to the finance manager of a business area, the scripting was to
automate credit card reconciliation from SAP and for producing monthly reporting
figures, I was lucky enough to have been spotted by one of the development
managers on a different team and offered a job as an Analyst Developer back in
2007, for the past 10 years I have mainly worked with VBA in Excel, Access, Word
and in some cases PowerPoint!

The majority of solutions I made at Barclays were workflow tools, the tracking
of a cheque or payment through a process, lots of greenfeild work with the focus
on using the tools the business had to hand, so, no SQL servers, just the MS
Office suite, "user needs a database? Ok cool lets set up an MS Access db on a
file server somewhere" yes!

Sectors I have worked in: Finance [Risk, Asset Management], Property, Oil & Gas
and currently in the Lloyd's insurance market.

Tools of my trade: VBA, SQL some VB.NET and C#

## My interests

As I'm devoting nearly every spare hour I have to sitting in front of a screen
and trying to make something happen, my main interests are currently:

* JavaScript learning all teh things!
  * React - [have done some projects][react-projects], nothing fancy!
  * Node - made several [Twitter bots][twit-bots].
* Things on my 'I should learn that list':
  * GraphQL
  * WebHooks, GitHub integrations, I really want to build a badge-bot!
  * Jest, TDD and BDD [more TDD] this should be on top of my list really!
* Tooling and work flow.

Other interests, I try to get to the gym three times a week to weight lift, that
took up quite a bit of my time over the last 3 years or so. I have focused on
the compound lifts bench, press, squat and my favourite [deadlift][deadlift]!

Before that I used to play tennis three times a week up to a county standard,
I'd love to have the time to play tennis again but between all the above there's
not much time left. ðŸ™ƒ

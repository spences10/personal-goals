**Thoughts ðŸ’­**

**20171119:** Decided to try make the `unfollow-inactive-accounts` bot, got caught up with `module.exports` and how to use arrays again then there's the Twitter API rate limits as well ðŸ˜ŽðŸ’¯

**20171126:** Got a touch sidetracked with Twitter bots, couldn't make any progress with `unfollow-inactive-accounts`bot but did make a breakthrough with delaying tweets from a Twitter API stream, which is nice ðŸ˜„

I made my own example then have made a PR for the 100 Days of Code Twitter bot as well, I found when doing this instead of dicking around with abstracting everything out into modules that I should have it all on one then worry about refactoring later, this was a good stratergy as I managed to make some progress!!!

**Thoughts ðŸ’­**

**20180226:** I didn't have a great start to the week with an
interview where my web dev trivia was being tested rather than being
asked how I would solve problems. What made this interview worse was
having the interview conducted in a cafeteria at lunch time where I
was also asked to take a technical test ðŸ˜ 

The week picked up as I was offered and have accepted a role as a
front end developer ðŸ˜‚

I had my first face to face with my Chungu cohorts and we planned the
next voyage for `grad.then`

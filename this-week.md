# This week

## 2017 Aug 07

**What I did do last week:**

- [x] nothing!

**What I didn't finish last week:**

**Plan for this week:**

- [ ] Configure the RAN bootstrap for Chungus Voyage, for me this is getting a schema to work with the bootstrap
- [ ] 100 days of code twitter bot, to use a GraphCool project to store the tweets

**Unplanned:**

- [x] [howtographql.com](howtographql.com) really useful! https://github.com/spences10/hackernews-react-apollo demo here: https://hnc.scottspence.me/

**Thoughts ðŸ’­**

I seem to have missed a week! ðŸ™ƒ The situation is RAN stack we need configured for the Chungus voyage project is being blocked until we get a backend up and running I'm finding it quite frustrating at the moment. The 100 days of code bot is getting some love because I can't move forward with the Chingus project.

I decided to do the hacker news clone as part of the how to graphql tutorial, was an eye opener.

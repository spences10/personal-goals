**Thoughts ðŸ’­**

**20171210:** After shaking off the disappointment from the interview on Monday
it's given me the drive to:

1. get my shit together before an interview
1. finish one thing! my personal site
1. FOCUS!!

right now I'm dicking around trying to style a nav component, wtf! why do I
struggle so much with this?

# This week

## 2017 Jun 19

**What I did do last week:**

- [x] Twitter bot work
- [x] Progress Learn Node w/ @WesBos

**What I didn't finish last week:**

- [ ] [Node basics][node-basics] with Emanuel Quimper

**Plan for this week:**

- [x] Start cohorts bot work
- [ ] Twitter bot work, filtered follow
- [x] Progress Learn Node w/ @WesBos

**Unplanned**

**Thoughts ðŸ’­**

Filtered follow is being a bit painful as I have to deal with promises ðŸ™ƒ

There's certainly a lot of bot frameworks out there! My cohorts and I seem unable to settle on a framework, @a-sep and I have both had a look at the MS Botframework and so far this is the one which make the most sense to us, basically it has documentation you can follow :+1:

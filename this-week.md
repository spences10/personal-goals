**Thoughts 💭**

Job interview on 20170710 👍 for something related to my current skillset but the possibility of moving into web related tech down the line.

Not heard back about the interview, so we'll take that as a no for now, the agent said that we'd hear back by Wednesday so I'll chase for feedback Monday.

I have gone through several getting started with GraphQL one which didn't work and another which was painful to navigate through, I have now got a guy from GraphCool on slack talking me through it.

Overall I'm really frustrated at the moment with progress on all the things, everything is shit 💩

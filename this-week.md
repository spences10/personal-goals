# This week

## 2017 Jul 24

**What I did do last week:**

- [x] Get familiar with GraphQL, maybe add a bit of functionality to the twitter-bot-twit change I made last week 
- [x] Start Chingu Voyage

**What I didn't finish last week:**

- [ ] I want to get some Follower/Unfolloer information into graphcool, not planned but a thought whilst doing this.

**Plan for this week:**

- [x] Chungu voyage init :fire:

**Unplanned:**

- [x] GraphQL getting started

**Thoughts ðŸ’­**

This week I will be getting to know my new cohorts and working in a remote dev team to do one of two things, make a bot [of some description] or make a clone of the site jobbatical.

My cohorts have come up with a great idea for what we're going to do for the Chungu Voyage were going to make a Single Page Application that other people can use to co-share or find a workspace and we're calling it HuddleHunt!

GraphQL is one of the requirements we have for HuddleHunt so I decided to take a egghead.io course on it, it got pretty confusing towards the end.

Made a bit of progress on the Twiotter bot follower/unfollower function which still needs some work.

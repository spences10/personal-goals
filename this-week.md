**Thoughts ðŸ’­**

**20171203:** This week I have two interviews lined up one tomorrow which I need
to put in some work for with Redux it was mentioned as something I should learn.
The other interview is for a VBA SQL Developer role but when I spoke with the
company on the phone the role sounded interesting.

**20171210:** The job interview I had Monday [04-Dec] highlighted some areas I
still need to work on, in hindsight I sould have prepare a lot more than I did
and the interview was way too soon after the phone interview.

Takeaways from the interview: make sure you're happy with coding exercises I was
pretty upset about missing out this time on the React front end developer role
to someone more experienced.

The interview on Wednesday [06-Dec] went ok as far as I can tell, they seemed to
be after a 'jack of all trades' developer which I do consider myself to be in
that region, I will hear back some time next week on their decision for that
role

I have decided to complete my site as it's a mess right now and I need to have
something to show potential employers, I have also decided that this is going to
be my full focus until it is completed

I'm also taking part in the Chingu Voyage 3 as PM for the bears-16 team, we're
making a static site in Gatsby

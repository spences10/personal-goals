**Thoughts ðŸ’­**

Watching the MVA on bot with Node, pretty neat, I quite like the Microsoft Virtual Academy.

With regard to TypeScript I have spent the best part of Sunday watching videos on how to migrate from JS to TS and felt completely overwhelmed, I'm trying to convert my current twitter bot playground over to TS and have managed to make a simple bot, I'm getting really hung up on what types to use that I'm making literally no progress in converting it all.

**Thoughts ðŸ’­**

**20180107:** Shaving the yak! I got caught up with bash issues through the week
so much so that I decided to wipe my laptop and start again, I have all my data
and programs backed up on OneDrive so it wasn't a really big issue.

I composed a post on configuring WSL as I've done it a few times now and made
notes, switched to `n` from `nvm` and the terminal appears to be a lot more
responsive.

As you can see from my WakaTime activity I shuold be concentrating more on the
`grad.then()` project, it's due to finish 20180114 so me and the guys wil have a
couple of busy day coming up!

# This week

## 2017 Jul 24

**What I did do last week:**

- [x] Chungu voyage init :fire:

**What I didn't finish last week:**

**Plan for this week:**

- [ ] Configure the RAN bootstrap for Chungus Voyage, for me this is getting a schema to work with the bootstrap

**Unplanned:**

- [ ] Started some work on the 100 days of code twitter bot, to use a GraphCool project to store the tweets

**Thoughts ðŸ’­**

We have taken on a massive challenge in our Chingus team with trying to get a React Apollo [GraphQL] and Next.js bootstrap stack up and running for out Sinlge Page Application

The RAN stack is being problematic to take the existing functionality and map it to a new backend that we can use ourselves. It's becoming time-consuming and is holding the project up, issues have been raised, forum posts, posted, my patience getting tested.

**Thoughts ðŸ’­**

Shitty week last week, the job situation is getting a bit worse now.

This week, Gatsby blog needs to happen, I have several posts which need to go in there, I can write them and wait but I think the cognitive stress of all the side projects I have is taking a toll so I need to focus on one aspect at a time.

I read a good Medium post on how to focus, I have taken a few things from that, one being the RescueTime software, I can use this along with the other metrics tools I have like WakaTime and CodeStats

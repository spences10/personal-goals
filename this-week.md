# This week

## 2017 Jul 10

**What I did do last week:**

- [ ] Made a [PR][tsbookpr] for [typescript-book][tsbook]

**What I didn't finish last week:**

- [ ] Progress cohorts bot work

**Plan for this week:**

Try get some sort of backend sorted for the twitter bot

**Unplanned**


**Thoughts 💭**

Job interview on 20170710 👍 for something related to my current skillset but the possibility of moving into web related tech down the line.

Not heard back about the interview, so we'll take that as a no for now, the agent said that we'd hear back by Wednesday so I'll chase for feedback Monday.

# This week

## 2017 Jul 17

**What I did do last week:**

- [x] Made a Settings repo https://github.com/spences10/settings
- [x] Made a Tooling repo https://github.com/spences10/tooling
- [x] Bearded Dragons Chingu finished

**What I didn't finish last week:**

- [ ] Twitter bot GraphQL backend (unfinished functionality)

**Plan for this week:**

- [ ] Get familiar with GraphQL, maybe add a bit of functionality to the twitter-bot-twit change I made last week 

**Unplanned**

- [x] Start Chingu Voyage

**Thoughts ðŸ’­**

The guys at graphcool were really helpful in getting me set up with a backend API thank you to @nilan from graphcool for your perseverance sir! I now have a working example of a selective retweet now so the RT on stream feature can eventually go to the Twitter bot bootstrap

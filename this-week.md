**Thoughts ðŸ’­**

Watching the MVA on bot with Node, pretty neat, I quite like the Microsoft Virtual Academy. All the code examples do not work so looks like something in the framework has changed, I'm pretty bummed out by this.

With regard to TypeScript I have spent the best part of Sunday watching videos on how to migrate from JS to TS and felt completely overwhelmed, I'm trying to convert my current twitter bot playground over to TS and have managed to make a simple bot, I'm getting really hung up on what types to use that I'm making literally no progress in converting it all.

I found a really nice guy on Twitter @LukeStonehm that helped out with some starter examples on making classes and interfaces with TypeScript.

Looking at storing tweets so the bot doesnt retweet already tweeted retweets, I tried to find some simple examples using MongoDB with express but all seem to not work or have outdated warnings, I'm going to take some time today to see if I can do it using GraphQL.

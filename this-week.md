**Thoughts ðŸ’­**

**20180424:** Still getting over this illness, it's really hit me for
six. Lost all motivation to do anything over the weekend, I need to
start listing out small wins to do for confidence and peace of mind.

**20180429:** Been a pretty meh week, a combination of getting over
sickness and at work coming to the realisation that I'll be working
with the most clanky ass unintuitive PoS CMS. I've felt depressed at
the prospect of working with it long term, so much so that it's
affecting my home life.

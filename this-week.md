**Thoughts ðŸ’­**

**20180329:** I have spent most of the week trying to get Gatsby and
GraphCMS working together, a lot of it is layout stuff currently ðŸ™ƒ

**20180330:** Happy Easter Friday! I'm becoming more of a fan of Mac
day by day, I'm also struggling more with a Windows keyboard. Why
couldn't Apple use the standard layout ðŸ™ƒ

**20180331:** I'm attempting to move my Gatsby blog from having the
posts stored on the actual site over to GraphCMS, this will lend well
to what I'm trying to accomplish at work as well.

**Thoughts ðŸ’­**

Bit of a meh week really, looking at my coding activity would probably say otherwise but I don't feel that anything was actually accomplished.

Still on the list of unfinished is the Gatsby blog which I now have about several versions of, there's always some issue with either images or code formatting and one or the other works. I get frustrated and move onto something else I think I can do in the meantime...

Have an interview on 30th with another insurer more than likely doing the same stuff as before with Chubb.

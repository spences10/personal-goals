# This week

## 2017 May 22

**What I did do last week:**

- [x] Writeup for [`twitter-bot-playground`][twit-bot-playground] repo
- [x] Personal site on `now`

**What I didn't finish last week:**

- [ ] [TypeScript React Starter][ts-react-starter]

**Plan for this week:**

- [ ] [Node basics][node-basics] with Emanuel Quimper
- [ ] Progress Learn Node w/ @WesBos

**Thoughts 💭**

Twitter bot playground was a pretty big writeup, I started the TypeScript react starter but need to get back to it.

With regard to the Wes Bos NodeJS course I keep getting errors on compass still waiting to hear back from the support team after giving feedback.

`now` I'm loving `zeit` and all their awesomeness 👍👌

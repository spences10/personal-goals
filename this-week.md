**Thoughts 💭**

**20180204:** Optimistic about getting several projects done, may try
to write a blog post about styled-components 💅 too 😄

**20180211:** Spent the most part of this week trying to finish off my
Framework of the Day app, based off of the Catch of the Day app it
replaced on my GitHub profile. I decided to go with NextJS this time
round instead of Gatsby still with styled-components 💅 made good
progress, styling taking up the majority of the time 🙃

I had two phone interviews this week as well one leading to a face to
face interview this coming Friday, the other was strange, they were
really keen to speak with me after viewing my GitHub profile but
didn't think I had enough JavaScript knowledge for the role. This
confused and frustrated me as the extent of my knowledge can be
gleaned from my CV which states in the first paragraph that I have got
18 months experience 🤷‍♀

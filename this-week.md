**Thoughts ðŸ’­**

**20180211:** I've had a massive drive to get my portfolio completed
and have some projects to demonstrate on there. I find that it's
always that last 10-20% of every project that determines it's success
or not. I proven this to myself with the last several projects I have
done - I'm doing it again with trying to complete Framework of the
Day.

# This week

## 2017 April 24

**What I did do last week:**

- [x] Learn redux with Wes Bos
- [x] Create react to-do app :+1:

**What I didn't finish last week:**

- [ ] ~~React online training https://online.reacttraining.com/courses/enrolled/50507~~
- [ ] Progress the react portfolio page
- [ ] ~~Take a look at [A workshop for ReactJS](https://github.com/fabe/react-portfolio)~~

**Plan for this week:**

- [ ] Twitter bot sentiment detection
- [ ] Twitter bot re-tweet functionality with `twitter` package
- [x] React portfolio page map project onto portfolio
- [x] Practiced making a open source [JavaScript library](https://egghead.io/courses/how-to-write-an-open-source-javascript-library)

**Thoughts ðŸ’­**

Seems that the react online training and A workshop for react are pretty dated so for now I'm going to move onto something else less so.

The twitter bot work is on hold for now as I can't get the retweet functionality to work

Some random div appearing on the portfolio page, for the react portfolio `.map` which I don't understand

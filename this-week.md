**Thoughts 💭**

Now looking for work, I have an interview lined up for monday with an energy trader.

It has been a really slow couple of weeks, partly because of the work situation partly because of burn out. Think I'm not on my third burn out of the year 🙃 it gets to a point where I feel completely overwhelmed with everything and as a result nothing happens.

I'm hoping I can get back into the swing of things with concentrating on one piece of work at a time.

**Update 20171001:** Spent the majority of my time putting my Gatsby site together and the rest of that getting familiar with different command line shells.

With Windows Subsystem Linux you have an Ubuntu instance in your Windows machine I spent way too much time familiarising myself with bash, zsh and fish shell 🐚, by far my favourite is Fish mainly for the command intellisense 👌

For the role I interviewed for on Monday I have been asked back for a second interview with another two candidates, no word on when this will be.

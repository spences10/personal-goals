**Thoughts ðŸ’­**

**20171126:** No plans as yet, this isn't boding very well for me learning full stack web dev, the majority of the courses I have I have either stopped [freeCodeCamp] or am part way through [the-web-developer-bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/the-web-developer-bootcamp) which I really should do but find I feel more productive completing my own projects that matter to me ðŸ™ƒ

**20171202:** Two interviews this week, both went well, two interviews lined up for next week currently. One is a follow up from a telephone interview on Friday for a JavaScript developer the other for a VBA SQL Developer 

**20171203:** Last week in review, I had a pretty hard time getting 'things' to work started with `semantic-release-cli` and `node-gyp` failing, this thing is a real ballache on windows - hence why I like to use WSL but it was still giving issues, I went on to spend the second half of the week trying to uninstall Docker then reinstall it.

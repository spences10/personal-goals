**Thoughts 💭**

**20171210:** After shaking off the disappointment from the interview on Monday
it's given me the drive to:

1. get my shit together before an interview
1. finish one thing! my personal site
1. FOCUS!!

right now I'm dicking around trying to style a nav component, wtf! why do I
struggle so much with this?

**20171217:** Wow!! What a week, learning quite a lot about using
`styled-components` 💅 with my other cohorts in Bears 🐻 16 team. This has been
a great learning experience on working on a dev team on a project. I have was
unanimously nominated PM by the other team members, I don't know why 🤷‍♂ but it
has made me consider ll parts of a project before doing any development work. We
have spent nearly a week trying to get all the components listed out.

# This week

## 2017 Aug 14

**What I did do last week:**

- [x] [howtographql.com](howtographql.com) really useful! https://github.com/spences10/hackernews-react-apollo demo here: https://hnc.scottspence.me/

**What I didn't finish last week:**

**Plan for this week:**

- [ ] Configure the RAN bootstrap for Chungus Voyage, for me this is getting a schema to work with the bootstrap
- [ ] 100 days of code twitter bot, to use a GraphCool project to store the tweets

**Unplanned:**


**Thoughts ðŸ’­**

Looks like the issues we were having with the RAN boilerplate were resolved in a recent PR, just a case of merging and seeing if were have something to work with. ;+1:

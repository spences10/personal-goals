**Thoughts 💭**

**20180708:** It has been a busy couple of weeks with work and life!
Just recovered from an extended weekend away to Gozo.

Work wise, I have completely migrated my blog to React Static bar one
feature that Gatsby has over React Static. That feature is PWA
functionality. I have spent a fair amount of time trying to get
something functional with no success.

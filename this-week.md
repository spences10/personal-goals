# This week

## 2017 Oct 02

**What I did do last week:**

- [x] Gatsby images working for blog
  * `inline` code highlighting not working
  * some styling
- [x] Get the Dang That's Delicious back up and running as and example of using Google Maps and geo location.
- [x] Twitter bot issues cleaned up

**What I didn't finish last week:**

- [ ] Get HuddleHunt up and running!

**Plan for this week:**

- [ ] Twitter following to followers ratio page
- [ ] Make some progress with a follow bot

**Unplanned:**

- [ ] Getting started with Express

**Thoughts 💭**

Last week was relatively productive, I got quite a few things finished and feel like and getting some momentum back.

This week I'd like to get a few things done, make some progress with a Twitter follow bot, this is quite tricky as I usually always blow my API limit when developing on this sort of thing.

I have a second [and final?] interview with the energy traders on Monday morning

HuddleHunt although has taken a bit of a back seat I know Tom is still keen on getting it up and running whilst he's studying for his MBA 👍

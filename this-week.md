## 2017 Jun 12

**What I did do last week:**

- [x] Join [Chingu-cohorts][cc]
  - [x] Write Chingu-cohorts intro
- [x] Made some Learn Node progress
- [x] [GraphQL with Apollo][gcl-tut]

**What I didn't finish last week:**

- [] Twitter bot work

**Plan for this week:**

- [] Twitter bot work
- [] [Node basics][node-basics] with Emanuel Quimper
- [] Progress Learn Node w/ @WesBos

**Unplanned**



**Thoughts 💭**

Made some ok progress with the Twitter bot filtered follow, still a bit to do with regard to scoring. `filtered-follow` will search a users timeline for keywords that are pulled from a gist.

Was nice to meet all my cohorts, we're still discussing a way forward with what is going to be a slack bot

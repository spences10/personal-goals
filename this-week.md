**Thoughts 💭**

**20180128:** Started the week off with a UTI on 20170120 with that
came a terrible fever. I spent the majority of Monday at an urgent
care center waiting to see a GP. I was prescribed strong antibiotics
and as a result have not been able to concentrate on anything longer
than five minutes. I have spent the majority of this week on the sofa
watching Netflix.

**20180131:** Used Gatsby image to lazy load project images on my
portfolio, it took a lot longer than anticipated, I nearly gave up but
my cohort mar-bi encourgaed me to take another look and that was all I
needed to make the breakthrough, such a win when that happens 👏 🙏

**Thoughts 💭**

**20171126:** No plans as yet, this isn't boding very well for me learning full stack web dev, the majority of the courses I have I have either stopped [freeCodeCamp] or am part way through [the-web-developer-bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/the-web-developer-bootcamp) which I really should do but find I feel more productive completing my own projects that matter to me 🙃

**Thoughts ðŸ’­**

Now looking for work, I have an interview lined up for monday with an energy trader.

It has been a really slow couple of weeks, partly because of the work situation partly because of burn out. Think I'm not on my third burn out of the year ðŸ™ƒ it gets to a point where I feel completely overwhelmed with everything and as a result nothing happens.

I'm hoping I can get back into the swing of things with concentrating on one piece of work at a time.

Plan for this week

## 2017 Sep 04

**What I did do last week:**

- [x] Relax

**What I didn't finish last week:**

**Plan for this week:**

- [ ] Get HuddleHunt up and running!

**Unplanned:**

- [ ] Terrible first few days back at work

**Thoughts 💭**

Good times :palm_tree: :shell: 🏖️

Holiday was the best! Getting back to work wasn't! The working situation has changed on the current contract with the client adding unnecessary requests on my time making it pretty poor working environment, that coupled with the work being menial it's not a great place to be right now.

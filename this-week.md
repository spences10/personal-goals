**Thoughts ðŸ’­**

Looking into TypeScript, I found a starter project here: https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript-Node-Starter thanks to @AmanMittal :+1:.

My cohorts have barely been in touch this week for the chingu challenge thing, I haven't done a great deal of work with the botbuilder stuff either though to be honest. I have found Microsoft Channel 9 and the Microsoft Virtual Academy though which are proving helpful.

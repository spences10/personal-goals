**Thoughts ðŸ’­**

My day job has become quite difficult since coming back from holiday, new manager, clearly doesn't trust me and has been clearly frustrated when I have a sit down/catchup and talks about current workload.

I can understand he will be under a fair bit of pressure both from himself starting in a new role and company and from his hiring manager.

With this [unnecessary] pressure from my client and with returning from holiday the last seven days hav been a bit of a shock to the system, I haven't wanted to get out of bed of a mornings and in the evenings I'm pretty bummed out from work.

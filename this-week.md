**Thoughts ðŸ’­**

**20180226:** Going to try get some blog posts finished, I had a good
go at the how to make time for 100 days of code post, need a little
longer to complete that.

**20180301:** Finished the 100 doc post now trying to complete a post
on the basics with styled components. I have a theme switcher working
which I'm quite proud of. I'll finish the post Tuesday.

# This week

## 2017 May 01

**What I did do last week:**

- [x] Creating an Open Source JavaScript Library
- [x] Progress the react portfolio page

**What I didn't finish last week:**

- [ ] Twitter bot sentiment detection
- [ ] Twitter bot re-tweet functionality with `twitter` package

**Plan for this week:**

- [x] JavaScript30 - all done ðŸ˜€

**Thoughts ðŸ’­**

Decided to churn my way through JavaScript30 a lot of the lessons I revisited but it was well worth it learned a lot [again maybe]

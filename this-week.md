**Thoughts ðŸ’­**

Not a great week for coding last week but I got the Characters from Password 'sort of' finished with the help of a kind contributor for the styling.

This week I'd like to get the cli tool for making a twitter bot in a semi working state, I'm currently struggling with creating the `.env` files after gathering the API keys from the cli

Once I have finished the CTB [create-twitter-bot] CLI I'd like to take another crack at the Lorem Ipsum API and generator I was intending to make but found that doing the Twitter Bot CLI is helping me understand a bit better what needs to go into the other tool

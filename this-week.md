# This week

## 2017 May 29

**What I did do last week:**

- [x] Played with styled components and nextjs

**What I didn't finish last week:**

- [ ] [TypeScript React Starter][ts-react-starter]

**Plan for this week:**

- [ ] [Node basics][node-basics] with Emanuel Quimper
- [ ] Progress Learn Node w/ @WesBos

**Thoughts ðŸ’­**

Nextjs is great, saved a load of time not messing around with react-router for links, the TypeScript react starter all went a bit shit and I lost interest with it.

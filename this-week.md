# This week

## 2017 May 08

**What I did do last week:**

- [x] JavaScript30 - all done ðŸ˜€

**What I didn't finish last week:**

**Plan for this week:**

- [x] Repurpose the [`twitter-bot-playground`][twit-bot-playground] repo
- [ ] [TypeScript React Starter][ts-react-starter]
- [x] Worked on [ArcherBot][archerbot]
  * Like functionality
- [x] Start Learn Node w/ @WesBos

**Thoughts ðŸ’­**

The Twitter bot tutorials I followed from [egghead.io][egghead-twitter-bot-course] I would recommend ðŸ‘Œ, I have been struggling with my next iteration of the [Twitter bot boot strap][twitter-bot-bootstrap] and this course really helped with some of the fundamentals of the Twitter API.

The [`twitter-bot-playground`][twit-bot-playground] was pretty good to deploy to `now` rather than `Heroku` admittedly I spent way too long trying to debug an issue that was just some similarlyy named vars.

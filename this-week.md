**Thoughts 💭**

From the two interviews last week I heard back about the contract role at the insurance brokers they felt that the other candidate articulated themselves better than myself sop went with them.

I'm not expecting to hear back from the other place I interviewed at [Barclays investors] anytime soon, these large organisations move at a glacial pace when it comes to the HR departments doing anything.

Completing the characters from password project was a big win for me as I struggled with it a while back and this time round I stuck with and finally got something to work, I still need to finish styling it now, which is another pain point for me, and another thing to work on 👍

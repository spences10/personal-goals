# This week

## 2017 Jul 17

**What I did do last week:**

- [x] Made a Settings repo https://github.com/spences10/settings
- [x] Made a Tooling repo https://github.com/spences10/tooling
- [x] Bearded Dragons Chingu finished

**What I didn't finish last week:**

- [ ] Twitter bot GraphQL backend (unfinished functionality)

**Plan for this week:**

- [x] Get familiar with GraphQL, maybe add a bit of functionality to the twitter-bot-twit change I made last week 

**Unplanned:**

- [x] Start Chingu Voyage

**Thoughts ðŸ’­**

The guys at graphcool were really helpful in getting me set up with a backend API thank you to @nilan from graphcool for your perseverance sir! I now have a working example of a selective retweet now so the RT on stream feature can eventually go to the Twitter bot bootstrap.

I'm reasonably happy with this functionality and have deployed to the master branch of my twitter-bot-twit repo, it needs work but so far I'm happy with the results.
